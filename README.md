Database for "Rent-a-car"
Our main domain in this project is to design and export a relational database for a chain of "Rent-a-car" stores.
We are firstly making an "ER (Entity Relationship) model", using a "Power designer" tool, and afterwards exporting it into a physical database on the server.
Business rules:
  1. We can have a multiple stores on different locations, which provide clients to land a car in one location and return it in another.
  2. Clients can choose available cars based on different car categoires (such as fuel type, carbody type, door type,...)
  3. All the stores have the same pricelist, which is being updated when necessary (but usually once a year)
  4. Pricelist also contains prices for different services provided by store branch. 
  5. Clients who rented cars from these stores more than 10 times can get discounts, but they may also be extra charged if they take certain actions (such as crossing        the border, damaging the car, not returning a vehicle with full tank ect.)
