Database for "Rent-a-car".
Our main domain in this project is to design and export a relational database for a chain of "Rent-a-car" stores.
We are firstly making an "ER (Entity Relationship) model", using a "Power designer" tool, and afterwards exporting it into a physical database which we are uploading on the server.
Business rules:
  1. We can have a multiple stores on different locations, which provide clients to land a car in one location and return it in another.
  2. Clients can choose available cars based on different car categoires (such as fuel type, carbody type, door type,...)
  3. All the stores have their pricelists, based on the cars available, which are being updated when necessary (usually twice a year)
  4. One member of staff can work in just one store.
  5. Clients can get various types of discounts, but they may also be extra charged if they take certain actions (such as crossing the border, damaging the car, not           returning a vehicle with full tank ect.). Clients can also choose to have different types of insurances.
